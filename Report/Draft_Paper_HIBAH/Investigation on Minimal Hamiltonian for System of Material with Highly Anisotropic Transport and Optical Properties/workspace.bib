abstract = "wannier90  is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90  is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90  is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90  2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90  is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Phys. Comm. 178(2008)685 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions [2] from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled, and using these Wannier functions to calculate electronic properties of materials. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required [3, 4].

abstract = "This article represents a continuation of a paper on AnBnO3n+2=ABOx compounds which was published in 2001 in this journal. This work reports also on oxides of the type A′Ak−1BkO3k+1 (Dion–Jacobson type phases) and hexagonal AmBm−1O3m. The title materials have in common a layered perovskite-related structure whose layers are formed by corner-shared BO6 octahedra. The three homologous series differ structurally in their orientation of the BO6 octahedra with respect to the c-axis. This can be considered as a result from cutting the cubic perovskite ABO3 structure along different directions followed by an insertion of additional oxygen, namely along the [100], [110] and [111] direction for A′Ak−1BkO3k+1, AnBnO3n+2 and AmBm−1O3m, respectively. The materials, with emphasis on electrical conductors, were prepared by floating zone melting and characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. On crystals of five different compounds the resistivity was measured along the distinct crystallographic directions. Concerning AnBnO3n+2 this work is focussed on two topics. The first are materials with paramagnetic rare earth ions at the A site or transition metal ions such as Fe3+ at the B site. The second are non-stoichiometric compounds. Furthermore, we discuss issues like occupational order at the B site, the proximity of some materials to the pyrochlore structure, potential magnetic ordering, and a possible coupling between magnetic and dielectric properties. The oxides A′Ak−1BkO3k+1 gained attention during a study of the reduced Ba–(Ca,La)–Nb–O system which lead to conducting Dion–Jacobson type phases without alkali metals. Concerning hexagonal AmBm−1O3m the emphasis of this work are conducting niobates in the system Sr–Nb–O. The title materials have in common a quasi-2D (layered) structure and they are mainly known as insulators. In the case of electrical conductors, however, their transport properties cover a quasi-1D, quasi-2D and anisotropic 3D metallic behavior. Also temperature-driven metal-to-semiconductor transitions occur. A special feature of the quasi-1D metals of the type AnBnO3n+2 is their compositional, structural and electronic proximity to non-conducting (anti)ferroelectrics. We speculate that these quasi-1D metals may have the potential to create new (high-Tc) superconductors, especially when they are viewed from the perspective of the excitonic type of superconductivity. Referring to literature and results from this work, a comprehensive overview on the title oxides and their properties is presented."

abstract = "ABOX niobates and titanates belonging to the homologous series AnBnO3n+2 are a special group of perovskite-related layered materials. These oxides comprise the highest-Tc ferroelectrics such as CaNbO3.50 and LaTiO3.50, as well as thermodynamically stable bulk compounds involving well-ordered stacking sequences of layers with different thickness such as SrNbO3.45. An extensive overview on many ABOX compositions of the AnBnO3n+2 family and its properties is presented. The crystal structure type is given by n and can be tuned by adjusting the oxygen content X. The charge carrier concentration of the electrical conducting oxides can be varied by appropriate substitutions at the A or B site. To investigate the properties of these systems, more than 150 different compositions were prepared. Most of them were grown by floating zone melting, of which many were fabricated as single crystals with precise control of the oxygen content X. For these crystalline compounds, the synthesis, structural, electric and magnetic features are discussed. Attempts to prepare series members beyond the known structure types n=4, 4.33, 4.5, 5 and 6 were not successful. For some of the known structures types n, however, pronounced non-stoichiometric homogeneity ranges with respect to the oxygen content X and cation ratio A/B were found. Thus, these systems offer many possibilities to vary the compositional, structural, chemical and physical properties. Further, measurements of the resistivity as a function of temperature T are reported for crystals of the n=4 type Sr0.8La0.2NbO3.50, n=4.5 type Sr0.96Ba0.04NbO3.45 and n=5 types Sr1−YLaYNbO3.41 (Y=0, 0.035, 0.1), Sr0.95NbO3.37, CaNbO3.41 and LaTiO3.41. These measurements, which were performed in the temperature range 4 K≤T≤290 K and along the a-, b- and c-axis, revealed a highly anisotropic conductivity and intricate behavior. In parts of the temperature range, these materials are quasi-1D metals which display temperature-driven metal-semiconductor transitions at lower temperatures. The niobates and titanates investigated represent a new group of quasi-1D metals which are in compositional, structural and electronical proximity to non-conducting layered (anti)ferroelectrics. Furthermore, measurements of the magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature are reported for many compounds. As a typical property at elevated temperatures, it was observed that the magnetic susceptibility rises with increasing temperature."
